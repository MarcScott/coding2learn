  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time...</p>
<p>No... Wait... Stop. </p>
<p>"Once upon a time...", is how you begin a nice story. It's how you begin a story about servant girls with horrible step-sisters, and footwear made of inappropriate materials notorious for cutting feet, and vehicles made from large orange fruit. "Once upon a time..." is for stories about wooden boys that come to life and go on adventures with inexplicably helpful grasshoppers. Once upon a time is for nice stories with happy endings and a moral message. "Once upon a time..." is for stories that you should read to children at bedtime.</p>
<p>This is not a nice story. This is a horrible story. This is a story with no moral message. This is a story with a horrible ending. This is a story that shouldn't be read to children at bedtime. Horrible, immoral stories that should never be read to children begin in a different way. These stores don't start with "Once upon a time...". These stories start with "In the beginning..."</p>
<h2>Part One</h2>
<p>In the beginning there was a stonnemason. He was a simple fellow, an uneducated Sumerian who liked nothing better than breaking large stones into smaller stones with his hammer and chisel. Like all Sumerians, although uneducated, he was able to count to sixty. He didn't know why sixty was so important, but it had something to do with the sun and the moon, and he knew this because the priests had told him so.</p>
<p>Priests all came from the Building Made Of Stone. There was no Sumerian word for Temple, it was just called the "Building Made Of Stone", because all the other buildings were made from mud. All the important people in Sumerian society worked in the Building Made From Stone. The stonemason spent a lot of time at there because they had a lot of work for him to do, turning large stones into smaller stones with his hammer and chisel.</p>
<p>One day, the stonemason was busy breaking big stones into smaller stones, when the High Priest came to him and told him to stop working. The High Priest told the stonemason that the "Priest In Charge Of Counting Sacks Of Grain" had been Sumerianly Executed (this is where we get the term "Summarily Executed" from), for putting his penis somewhere he wasn't allowed. The High Priest told the stonemason, that he needed to count all the sacks of grain that were coming into the Building Made Of Stone, as there was nobody else around that could do it.</p>
<p>Lots of sacks of grain arrived every day. The High Priest charged everyone in the area a Sumerian Tax, and made them hand over sacks of grain, flocks of sheep and disks of yellow coloured metal (This is where we get the term "Tax Summary" from). It was important that the High Priest always knew how many sacks of grain, flocks of sheep and disks of yellow metal he had available to him, which was why he had priests in charge of doing all the counting.</p>
<p>The stonemason knew not to argue with the High Priest, if he didn't want to be Sumerianly executed, so he agreed to count sacks of grain. He did a fine old job for the first part of the day, but as he continued counting he soon realised that he was going to run out of numbers, what with sixty being the highest number he knew.</p>
<p>As the stonemason counted his sixtieth sack of grain, and saw the next one being unloaded into the Building Made Of Stone, he knew of only one way out of his dilemma. He hit a bit of stone with his hammer and chisel. To be honest, this was his way out of most dilemmas. As a stonemason, he'd often found that there were few problems that couldn't be solved by hitting a bit of stone with his hammer and chisel. If he'd been a butcher, he would have probably slaughtered a goat in this situation, and this would be a very different and much bloodier story.</p>
<p>On this occasion though, hitting a bit of stone with a hammer and chisel worked. He left a mark on the lump of stone, and was able to start counting from 1 again and keep counting as the sacks of grain came into the counting house. When he reached sixty, he hit the stone with his hammer and chisel again, left a second mark, and started counting from one.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, the stonemason had counted three hundred and sixty sacks of grain, although he didn't know this number existed. But he knew that he had six marks on the stone, and for each mark he had counted sixty sacks of grain. This made him the most successful counter the "Buildings Made Of Stone" had ever had.</p>
<p>The High Priest was very happy with the stonemason. Nobody had every before counted to sixty, six times and been able to keep track of the number of sixties. He was so happy in fact, that he Sumerianly executed all the other counting priests and made the stonemason the "Counting Priest Of All Things".</p>
<p>The "Counting Priest Of All Things" now had a problem. He was good at counting sacks of grain, but he now had to count sheep and discs of yellow metal as well. He thought long and hard about how he would be able to count grain, sheep and yellow metal, and using the skills that had been past down from generations of stonemasons before him, he came upon a solution. He would hit the lump of stone with his hammer and chisel, but in slightly different ways.</p>
<p>The Counting Priest hit the stone in one way for sixty sacks of grain, another way for sixty sheep and another way for yellow metal. Soon he was counting more sacks of grain, sheep and yellow metal than any other "Building Made Of Stone" in the whole of Sumer, and the High Priest was mightily pleased.</p>
<p>So pleased was the High Priest, and so amazed was he that the former stonemason could remember so many sacks of grain, sheep and discs of yellow metal, that he decided to promote the "Counting Priest Of All Things" to being the "Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make".</p>
<p>The new "Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make" now had a tricky problem ahead of him. There were literally sixty sixty sixties of rules that the Gods had made, and the High Priest kept announcing new ones every day. It would be very difficult to remember all of the rules.</p>
<p>The new "Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make" did however notice a pattern in the rules. Most of the rules had to do with grain, sheep, yellow metal and where you were allowed to put your penis. The Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make realised he already had marks in stone that represented sacks of grain, sheep and yellow metal. He just needed a new mark in the stone that meant "penis" and he could probably mark all the rules the Gods made in bits of stone.</p>
<p>Eventually the Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make had devised lots of different way of hitting bits of stone with his hammer and chisel, to represent lots of different rules. As he was the only one that knew what the marks meant, he ended up being the only one that remembered all the rules. He even remembered a rule that meant the High Priest had to be Sumerianly Executed for not remembering all the rules. He also remembered a rule that High Priest could put their penises wherever they damn well pleased, and he went on to have lots of children, all of whom became High Priests as he had taught them how to read the rules.</p>
<h2>Part Two</h2>
<p>A few thousand years past, and a lot changed. Well... not a lot really. I mean, there were still priests that worked in "Buildings Made Of Stone", that knew all the rules, but they were now written on the skins of dead animals using soot and spoiled wine.</p>
<p>There were also a lot more priests. There were priests all over the world, and they were all telling people about The Rules That The Gods Makes, by reading them from the skins of dead animals every weekend. The problem was that with a lot of priests all writing The Rules That The Gods Make, sometimes the rules seemed to contradict each other a little. For instance, sometimes a priest would reveal that A Rule The Gods Made was that it was okay for priests to put their penises anywhere they liked. Other priests would write down rules that said priests shouldn't put their penises anywhere. Luckily, this confusion would not go on to cause any problems is the future or lead to the deaths of thousands.</p>
<p>Eventually it was decided that the only way to sort out all the problems was to write a definitive set of rules that all the priests should use. First of all, they decided that there was only one God that made all the rules... or maybe it was three gods? It was definitely one God or three Gods and it seemed few could really decide which one it was. Luckily this would not go on to cause any problems in the future or lead to the deaths of thousands.</p>
<p>The priests took all the rules that other priests had written and chose the ones that had definitely been Rules That God Had Made, and not just ones that priests had made up. They then put all the rules into a book that would be the definitive set of The Rules That God Made, and than nobody could argue with... Or maybe it was three books. It was all a little uncertain at the time, what with there being three different books, each supposedly being the definitive Rules That God Made.</p>
<p>One thing was certain however. It was decided that God only understood one language out of the three popular languages at around that time, that each of the three books were written in. Which of the languages was the only one the omniscient God understood was debated a little, but everyone was pretty sure that the omniscient God only understood one of them. Luckily, this confusion would not go on to cause any problems is the future or the deaths of thousands.This was quite lucky for the priests as well, as they were the only ones that understood one of the three languages, and so were the only ones that could really explain to everyone else what The Rules That God Made were.</p>
<h2>Part Three</h2>
<p>A few hundred years later, and a lot had changed. Well... not a lot really. I mean, there were still priests that worked in Buildings Made Of Stone, that knew all the rules, but they were written on crushed up vegetable matter now. They still told people what to think, and what to do, and how many sacks of grain, sheep, and yellow metal they should give to the priests every year. But now there were also Kings. Kings were always born in Buildings Made Of Stone, rather than simply working there. Kings were like priests, because they could read and write The Rules That God Made. However, Kings could also write The Rules That The King Made. These rules were similar to The Rules That God Made, although they tended to be a little more explicit in their demands for grain, sheep, and yellow metal. Also, if you broke The Rules That God Made, you were punished forever after you died, where as if you broke The Rules That The King Made, you were punished for a very short amount of time, just before you died.</p>
<p>In some places Kings and Priests were just friends with each other. In some places Kings were in charge of the Priests, and in other places the Priests were in charge of the Kings. In some places the Kings decided they were Priests and the Priests decided they were Kings. No matter what, it was definitely the ability to read and write in the only language the omniscient God understood that marked you as a Priest or a King. This caused a few arguments between Kings and Kings, Kings and Priests, and Priests and Priest. Luckily, this would not go on to cause any problems is the future or the deaths of thousands.</p>
<p>During this time, Priests would spend a lot of time copying out The Rules That God Made and The Rules That The King Made, on to bits of crushed up vegetable matter using soot and spoiled wine. They couldn't do this very quickly, and so not many people got to read The Rules That God Made and The Rules That The King Made. This suited the Priests and the Kings though, as they could just tell people about the rules and nobody could really argue with them.</p>
<h2>Part Four</h2>
<p>A few hundred years later, and a lot had changed. Well... not a lot really. I mean, there were still priests that worked in Buildings Made Of Stone and Kings that were born in Buildings Made Of Stone, but there were now Gentlemen as well. Gentlemen were men that had been educated in Buildings Made of Stone. Many Gentlemen were friends with Priests and Kings. Some Gentlemen were related to Priests and Kings. The one thing that made Gentlemen different from the people that lived in buildings made of mud, was that they had been taught one of the three languages that The Rules That God Made were written in, only one of which the omniscient God could understand.</p>
<p>Gentlemen owned the land on which the building made of mud were built, and they collected a lot of grain, sheep and yellow metal from the people that lived in the buildings made of mud. This meant that they didn't lead very busy lives, and so had plenty of time to invent things. They invented Rules That The Universe Made, for instance, which turned out to be far more complicated and weird than The Rules That God Made. They also invented Rules That Gentlemen Elected By Other Gentlemen To Positions of Authority Made, which were even more complicated than The Rules That The Universe Made, but quite often made less sense than The Rules That God Made. Probably, the most interesting thing that the Gentlemen invented though was The Machine That Can Stamp Soot And Spoiled Wine On Crushed Up Vegetable Matter Really Quickly And In Any Language You Like. This was a stupid name for the machine, so people ended up calling it the Printing Press.</p>
<p>The Priests and Kings and Gentlemen loved the Printing Press because they could write lots of copies of the rules for other Priests and Kings and Gentlemen. They also hated the Printing Press, because it meant that lots of copies of the rules were being read by the people who lived in buildings made of mud. Worse than that, some of the rules were being printed in languages other than the only language that the omniscient God understood. This meant that the people living in buildings made of mud could read the rules, and not just have them read to them by Priests on the weekends.</p>
<p>Some people started printing things other than rules though. Some people started printing what was happening in the World and what you should think about it. If a King went to war with another King, over whether or not The Rules That God Made should be written in the language one King understood or the language the other King spoke, people would print stories about it and tell the people who lived in houses made of mud what they should think about it. This upset the Kings and Priests and Gentlemen. They felt they should be able to send the people who lived in houses made of mud off to fight other Kings, without learning the reasons why they were doing it. </p>
<p>The Kings came up with a simple solution to the problem of people who lived in buildings made of mud learning all the rules. They made sure that only the Gentlemen were allowed to own Printing Presses. This made sure that the only rules that people were allowed to read were the things that the Gentlemen printed. As the Gentlemen were all friends and relations with the Kings and Priests, it turned out that people were only told stories that the Priests and Kings and Gentlemen wanted them to read, and they were always told to think that the things that Priests and Kings and Gentlemen did were very good.</p>
<h2>Part Five</h2>
<p>A few hundred years later, and a lot had changed. Seriously... everything had fucking changed. Nobody really listened to the Priests anymore. Occasionally a priest would put his penis into somewhere he wasn't supposed to and that would make the mud dwellers angry. Occasionally a priest would tell a mud dweller to kill lots of other mud dwellers, and the mud dwellers became angry. Kings weren't very important either. They were mostly used to show off nice clothes and complain about how all the buildings were being built of steel and slass and plastic, and not stone anymore. What had really changed the world though were the inventions of bunch of clever gentlemen.</p>
<p>The first Gentleman had spent a lot of his life trying to understand secret messages. He had been doing this to allow mud dwellers from one Kingdom to kill mud dwellers from another Kingdom more easily. He didn't really like all the killing, but he loved secret messages. It turned out that the best way to read the secret messages was to use a Machine That Could Count Very Quickly, although rather than counting to sixty it only counted to one. Eventually Gentlemen figured out that you could use The Machines That Count Very Quickly to do lots of other things, like help figure out The Rules The Universe Made and also to play Pong. The gentleman that invented The Machine That Could Count Very Quickly eventully killed himself with an apple, he broke one of The Rules That God Made about where people were allowed to put their penises, and was being punished for it.</p>
<p>A really important invention then came along, when some gentlemen learned how to make the Machine That Could Count Very Quickly talk to each other. Even though the machines could only count to one, they could turn lots of ones and zeros into words that you could read on the screen. This meant that gentlemen all over the world could send words to each other using the Machines That Could Count Very Quickly. It wasn't very easy to use though, so only the cleverest gentlemen really used it.</p>
<p>Then another Gentleman, developed a way for The Machines That Could Count Very Quickly to act like an enormous Printing Press. Anyone could write anything they liked on their own Machines That Count Very Quickly, and anyone else in the World who also had a Machine That Could Count Very Quickly could read their words. </p>
<p>At first nobody cared much about the Planetary Printing Press, except for people that were trying to figure out more of The Rules That The Universe Made, and a few other people that were trying to figure out The Rules That The Machines That Count Very Quickly Made. Priests and Kings and Gentlemen really didn't care much about it, but slowly more and more mud dwellers began to buy the machines and even started carrying them around in their pockets. More and more things were being written on the PPP, and there were even pictures and moving pictures, often of people putting their penises in all kinds of places.</p>
<p>Slowly the Gentlemen began to become worried. The Gentlemen were used to telling everyone in the world, what was happening and how they should think about it. That was why they owned all the Printing Presses, so that everybody could learn to think that the Gentlemen were doing a good job and should be given more sacks of grain and sheep and disks of yellow metal.</p>
<p>At first the Gentlemen reasoned that if they owned all The Machines That Could Count Very Quickly, that stored everything the mud dwellers wrote, they would be able to control what they thought about things. This didn't really work though, as when a mud dweller wrote something on their Machine That Could Count Very Quickly, they didn't like it when their words were changed.</p>
<p>A few years later and the Gentlemen found a solution to the problem of mud dwellers thinking their own thoughts and making their own rules. The Gentleman's solution had two parts. Firstly they decided that they should look at everything the mud dwellers wrote. They would collect and store every word of the mud dwellers. It didn't really help at catching People Who Ignored the Rules That Gentlemen Wrote, but it turned out that when the average mud dweller knew he was being watched, every time he wrote words, he tended to only write words that supported the Gentlemen. The second thing to do was to </p></div>
