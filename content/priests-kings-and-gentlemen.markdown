Once upon a time...

No... Wait... Stop. 

"Once upon a time...", is how you begin a nice story. 

It's how you begin a story about children that get lost in a forest, houses made of gingerbread, and killing old women by pushing them into ovens.

"Once upon a time..." is for stories about princesses and spinning wheels and handsome princes that molest young women who are comatose.

"Once upon a time..." is for stories about stupid children that don't understand the value of beans, that trespass on other people's property, steal their live stocks, and then kill them as their being chased away. 

Okay, maybe "Once upon a time..." isn't for nice stories, but it is for stores you read to children at bedtime, for stories with a clear moral message, for stories that can be turned into cartoons.

This is not a nice story. This is a horrible story. This is a story with no moral message. This is a story with a horrible ending. This is a story that shouldn't be read to children at bedtime, and no fucker is turning this story into a cartoon. Horrible, immoral stories that should never be read to children begin in a different way. These stores don't start with "Once upon a time...". These stories start with "In the beginning..."

## Part One

In the beginning there was a stonemason. He was a simple fellow, a Sumerian who liked nothing better than breaking large stones into smaller stones with his hammer and chisel. Like all Sumerians he was able to count to sixty. He didn't know why sixty was so important, but it had something to do with the sun and the moon, and he knew this because the priests had told him so.

The priests all lived and worked in The Buildings Made Of Stone, whereas everyone else lived and worked in buildings made of mud. The stonemason spent a lot of time at The Buildings Made Of Stone, because the priests had a lot of work for him to do, turning large stones into smaller stones with his hammer and chisel, so that the priests could make their buildings even bigger and better.

One day, the stonemason was busy breaking big stones into smaller stones, when the High Priest came to him and ordered him to put down his hammer and chisel. The High Priest told him that the "Priest In Charge Of Counting Sacks Of Grain" had been Sumerianly executed (this is where we get the term "Summarily Executed" from), for putting his penis somewhere he wasn't allowed. The High Priest told the stonemason, that he needed to count all the sacks of grain that were coming into the Building Made Of Stone, as there were no priests available to do the job. He also told the stonemason not to put his penis anywhere he shouldn't..

Lots of sacks of grain arrived at The Building Made Of Stone, every day. The High Priest taxed everyone in the area with a Sumerian tax, and made them hand over grain, sheep, and yellow coloured metal. The High Priest kept a careful record of this Sumerian tax and how much everyone had paid (this is where we get the term "Tax Summary" from). It was important that the High Priest always knew how many sacks of grain, flocks of sheep and lumps of yellow metal he had available to him, which was why he had priests in charge of doing all the counting.

The stonemason knew not to argue with the High Priest, if he didn't want to be Sumerianly executed, so he agreed to count sacks of grain. He did a fine old job for the first part of the day, but as he continued counting he soon realised that he was going to run out of numbers, what with sixty being the highest number he knew.

As the stonemason counted his sixtieth sack of grain, and saw the next one being unloaded into The Building Made Of Stone, he knew of only one way out of his dilemma. He hit a bit of stone with his hammer and chisel. To be honest, this was his way out of most dilemmas. As a stonemason, he'd often found that there were few problems that couldn't be solved by hitting a bit of stone with his hammer and chisel. If he'd been a butcher, he would have probably slaughtered a goat in this situation, and this would be a very different and much bloodier story.

On this occasion though, hitting a bit of stone with a hammer and chisel worked. He left a mark on the lump of stone, and was able to start counting from one again, and keep counting as the sacks of grain came into the counting house. When he reached sixty for the second time, he hit the stone with his hammer and chisel again, left a second mark, and started counting from one.

By the end of the day, the stonemason had counted three hundred and sixty sacks of grain, although he didn't know this number existed. But he knew that he had six marks on the stone, and for each mark he had counted sixty sacks of grain. This made him the most successful counter the priests had ever seen.

The High Priest was very happy with the stonemason. Nobody had every counted this many sacks of grain before, and been able to keep track of the number of sixties. The High Priest was so happy, that he Sumerianly executed all the other counting priests and made the stonemason "The Priest Of Counting All Things".

"The Priest Of Counting All Things" now had a problem. He was good at counting sacks of grain, but he now had to count sheep and lumps of yellow metal as well. He thought long and hard about how he would be able to count grain, sheep and yellow metal, and using the skills that had been past down from generations of stonemasons before him, he came upon a solution. He would hit a bit of stone with his hammer and chisel, but in slightly different ways.

The Counting Priest hit the stone in one way for sacks of grain, another way for sheep and another way for yellow metal. Soon he was counting more sacks of grain, sheep and yellow metal than any priest in the whole of Sumer, and the High Priest was mightily pleased.

So pleased was the High Priest, and so amazed was he that the former stonemason could remember so many sacks of grain, sheep and lumps of yellow metal, that he decided to promote "The Priest Of Counting All Things" to being The Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make.

The new Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make now had a tricky problem ahead of him. There were literally sixty sixty sixties of Rules That The Gods Made, and the High Priest kept announcing new ones every day. It would be very difficult to remember all of the rules.

The Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make did however notice a pattern in the rules. Most of the rules had to do with grain, sheep, yellow metal and where you were allowed to put your penis. The Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make realised he already had marks in stone that represented sacks of grain, sheep and yellow metal. He just needed a new mark in the stone that represented "penis" and he could probably more or less chisel all the rules into some stone.

Eventually the Priest That Remembers All The Rules That The Gods Make had devised lots of different way of hitting bits of stone with his hammer and chisel, to represent lots of different rules. As he was the only one that knew what the marks meant, he ended up being the only one that remembered all the rules. He even remembered a rule that meant the High Priest had to be Sumerianly Executed for not remembering all the rules. He also remembered a rule that the new High Priest could put his penis wherever he damned well pleased, and he went on to have lots of children, all of whom became High Priests as well and were taught how to make marks in bits of stone.

## Part Two

A few thousand years past, and a lot changed. Well... not a lot really. I mean, there were still priests that worked in "Buildings Made Of Stone", that knew all the rules, but they were now written on the skins of dead animals using soot and spoiled wine. The rest of the people were all still mud-dwellers, and as they couldn't read, they relied on the priests to tell them what to do and how to think.

There were lots more priests though. There were priests all over the world, and they were all telling people about The Rules That The Gods Make, by reading them from the skins of dead animals every weekend. The problem was, that with a lot of priests all writing All The Rules That The Gods Make, sometimes the rules seemed to contradict each other a little. For instance, sometimes a priest would reveal that there was a rule that it was okay for priests to put their penises anywhere they liked. Other priests would write down rules that said priests shouldn't put their penises anywhere. Luckily, this confusion would not go on to cause any problems is the future or lead to the deaths of thousands.

Eventually it was decided that the only way to sort out all the problems was to write a definitive set of rules that all the priests should use. First of all, they decided that there was only one God that made all the rules... or maybe it was three gods? It was definitely one God or three Gods and it seemed few could really decide which one it was. Luckily this would not go on to cause any problems in the future or lead to the deaths of thousands.

The high priests took all the rules that other priests had written and chose the ones that had definitely been The Rules That God Had Made, and not just ones that other priests had made up. They then put all the rules into a book... Well actually it was three books, but one thing was for sure, one of the three books was the canonical set of The Rules That God Made, and that nobody could argue with. Luckily this would not go on to cause any problems in the future or lead to the deaths of thousands.

One thing was certain however. It was decided that God only understood one language. Which of all the world's languages was the only one that the omniscient God understood was debated a little, but everyone was pretty sure that the omniscient God only understood one of them. Luckily, this confusion would not go on to cause any problems is the future or the deaths of thousands.

The whole one language thing was quite lucky for the priests as well, as they were the only ones that could read any of the languages, and so were the only ones that could really explain to the mud dwellers what they should do and how they should think.

## Part Three

A few hundred years later, and a lot had changed. Well... not a lot really. I mean, there were still priests in Buildings Made Of Stone, that knew all the rules, but they were written on crushed up vegetable matter now. They still told the mud-dwellers what to think, and what to do, and how many sacks of grain, sheep, and yellow metal they should give to the priests every year. But now there were also Kings. 

Kings were born in Buildings Made Of Stone, rather than simply working there. Kings were like priests, because they could read and write The Rules That God Made. However, Kings could also write The Rules That The King Made. These rules were similar to The Rules That God Made, although they tended to be a little more explicit in their demands for grain, sheep, and yellow metal. Also, if you broke The Rules That God Made, you were punished forever after you died, whereas if you broke The Rules That The King Made, you were punished for a very short amount of time, just before you died.

In some places Kings and Priests were just friends with each other. In some places Kings were in charge of the Priests, and in other places the Priests were in charge of the Kings. In some places the Kings decided they were Priests and the Priests decided they were Kings. No matter what, it was definitely the ability to read and write in the single language the omniscient God understood that marked you as a Priest or a King. This caused a few arguments between Kings and Kings, Kings and Priests, and Priests and Priests. Luckily, this would not go on to cause any problems is the future or the deaths of thousands.

During this time, Priests would spend a lot of time copying out The Rules That God Made and The Rules That The King Made, on to bits of crushed up vegetable matter using soot and spoiled wine. They couldn't do this very quickly, and so not many mud-dwellers got to read The Rules That God Made and The Rules That The King Made. This suited the Priests and the Kings though, as they could just tell people what the rules were and nobody could disagree with them.

## Part Four

A few hundred years later, and a lot had changed. Well... not a lot really. I mean, there were still priests that worked in Buildings Made Of Stone and Kings that were born in Buildings Made Of Stone, and of course the mud-dwellers. The mud was now cooked in ovens to make it really hard, but it was still just mud really. There was also a new type of person called a Gentleman. Gentlemen were mud-dwellers that had been educated in Buildings Made of Stone, where they had been taught to read and write the only language which the omniscient God could understand.

Gentlemen owned the land on which the building made of mud were built, and they collected a lot of grain, sheep and yellow metal from the mud dwellers. As the gentlemen didn't have to spend all their time trying to figure out how not to starve to death, they had plenty of time to invent things. They invented The Rules That The Universe Made, for instance, which turned out to be far more complicated and weird than The Rules That God Made. They also invented Government, and The Rules That Government Made, which were often more complicated than The Rules That The Universe Made, and a lot stupider than The Rules That God Made. Probably, the most interesting thing that the Gentlemen invented though was The Machine That Can Stamp Soot And Spoiled Wine On Crushed Up Vegetable Matter Really Quickly And In Any Language You Like. This was a stupid name for the machine, so people ended up calling it the printing press.

The Priests and Kings and Gentlemen loved the printing press because they could write lots of copies of the rules for other Priests and Kings and Gentlemen. They also hated the Printing Press, because it meant that lots of copies of the rules were being read by the mud dwellers. Worse than that, some of the rules were being printed in languages other than the only language that the omniscient God understood. This meant that, for the first time, the mud dwellers could read the rules themselves, and have their own thoughts about them, rather than being told what to think by the priests and kings and gentlemen..

Some people started printing things other than rules though. Some people started printing words about what was happening in the World and what you should think about it. Sometimes they wrote about how the priests and kings and gentlemen were not really following the rules themselves. Sometimes they wrote about how mud dwellers should probably have a little bit more of the grain and sheep and yellow metal, what with them doing all the work. Sometimes they wrote about how all the rules were bullshit, and wasn't it about time that there were some Rules That Mud Dwellers Made.

The priests and kings and gentlemen didn't like this very much, and so came up with a simple solution to the problem. They made sure that only the gentlemen were allowed to own printing presses. This made sure that the only rules that people were allowed to read and write were the things that the gentlemen printed. This way people were only told stories that the gentlemen wanted them to read, and they were always told to think thoughts that the gentlemen wanted them to think. This made the gentlemen very powerful.

Some of the gentlemen then came up with the grand idea of writing rules that told mud dwellers that they really didn't need The Rules That God Made, or The Rules That The King Made, and that it was absolutely fine to get rid of the Kings and the Priest and just stick with The Rules That Government Made. Luckily this would not go on to cause any problems in the future or lead to the deaths of thousands.

## Part Five

A few hundred years later, and a lot had changed. Seriously... everything had fucking changed. Nobody really listened to the priests anymore. Occasionally a priest would put his penis somewhere he wasn't supposed to and that would make the mud dwellers angry. Occasionally a priest would tell a mud dweller to kill lots of other mud dwellers, and the mud dwellers became angry. Kings weren't very important either. Some places had even killed all their kings. Where kings still existed they were mostly used to show off nice clothes and complain about how nobody was making Buildings Made Of Stone anymore.. What had really changed the world though was the inventions of a very clever gentlemen.

The gentleman had spent a lot of his life trying to understand secret messages. He had been doing this to allow mud dwellers from one Kingdom to kill mud dwellers from another Kingdom more easily. He didn't really like all the killing, but he loved secret messages. It turned out that the best way to read the secret messages was to use a Machine That Could Count Very Quickly, although rather than counting to sixty it only counted to one. Eventually other gentlemen figured out that you could use The Machines That Could Count Very Quickly to do lots of other things. The machines could help work out The Rules The Universe Made, they could be use to work out how much yellow metal the mud dwellers owed other gentlemen, they could be used to send messages to each other, and more importantly they could be used to play Pong. The gentleman that invented The Machines That Could Count Very Quickly eventually killed himself with an apple to avoid being punished for breaking one of the penis rules.

At first nobody cared much about the Machines That Could Count Very Quickly. Priests and Kings and gentlemen especially didn't care much about them, but slowly more and more mud dwellers began to buy the machines and even started carrying them around in their pockets. More and more things were being written on the machines and shared with everyone else's machine. There were millions of words being written, and there were even pictures and moving pictures, often of cats or of people putting their penises in *all* kinds of strange places.

Slowly the gentlemen began to become worried. The gentlemen were used to telling everyone in the world, what was happening and how they should think about it. But now the mud dwellers were writing their own words and thinking their own thoughts, and sharing their words and their thoughts with other mud dwellers.

Mud dwellers were writing their own rules on The Machines That Could Count Very Quickly. They were writing in languages the omniscient God couldn't understand, and even made up their own languages, using words like "lolz" and "haz" and "cheezburger". Some mud dwellers even wrote The Rules That God Made in  this language, 

## Now

A few years later and... Well I just want to fucking give up.

It had started well. Gentlemen and even Kings and Priests became worried about all the things the mud dwellers were writing on their Machines That Could Count Very Quickly. In some countries whole revolutions had been organised by words written on the machines, and a new Government had to be chosen, although it still seemed to be mostly made up of Gentlemen that had been educated in Buildings Made Of Stone. Some of the Gentlemen tried to write Rules That Government Makes that would stop mud dwellers writing whatever they wanted, but most of the time these rules didn't work and were forgotten about.

But then it all became very confusing. You see, mud dwellers had stopped writing words on their own Thinking Machines That Could Count Very Quickly, and had instead used machines owned by people who had been educated in Buildings Made Of Stone. Then Governments started using the Gentlemen's machines as well, sometimes to lie to the mud dwellers, and sometimes to tell them the truth, which was often even worse. The mud dwellers became very confused about all of this, and the Gentlemen that controlled the Governments and the Gentlemen that controlled the machines just tried to make it even more confusing, in the hopes of getting more sacks of grain and sheep and lumps of yellow metal.

The mud dwellers continued to be lied to, or told the truth to, and the Gentlemen kept collecting more of the grain and the sheep and the lumps of yellow metal. Everyone ignored The Rules That God Makes, and The Rules That Government Makes, and the mud dwellers became less powerful and had less grain and sheep and lumps of yellow metal.

Luckily this would not go on to cause any problems in the future or lead to the deaths of thousands.
